DESCRIPTION :

The project titled “Automated Report Generation Using Python and ReportLab” focuses on the development of a software solution that automatically converts structured data stored in a CSV file into a professionally formatted PDF report. The primary objective of this program is to eliminate the need for manual report preparation by automating data reading, analysis, and presentation in a visually appealing and well-structured document. This project is particularly suitable for academic submissions, internships, and real-world reporting applications where efficiency and accuracy are critical.

The system begins by reading data from an external CSV file using Python’s built-in CSV module. This approach ensures flexibility, allowing the data source to be easily replaced or updated without altering the program logic. During the data extraction phase, the program filters out empty or invalid rows and identifies numerical values required for analysis. These values are processed using Python’s statistics module to compute essential metrics such as the average score, highest score, and lowest score. These statistical values provide meaningful insights and form the analytical core of the report.
Once the analysis is complete, the program generates a PDF document using the SimpleDocTemplate class from the ReportLab library. The document layout is designed using standard A4 page dimensions with customized margins to ensure proper spacing and readability. The report begins with a prominent title that is center-aligned and styled using custom fonts and colors to enhance visual appeal. This is followed by a summary statistics section where the calculated metrics are presented clearly using formatted text.
The detailed data section displays the complete dataset in a structured table format. ReportLab’s table styling features are used extensively to improve presentation quality. The table header is highlighted with a colored background and bold text, while grid lines and alignment ensure clarity and professionalism. Such formatting makes the report suitable for official documentation and presentations.
